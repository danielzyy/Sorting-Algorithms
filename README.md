# Sorting-Algorithms
This repository will contain Java methods that can sort a set of numbers from lowest to highest with different algorithms, along with a brief description about how they work.

<h1>List of Sorting Algorithms Used:</h1>
<ul>
  	<li><b>Insertion Sort: </b> 
  		<p>Insertion sort works by taking a number and inserting it in its correctly sorted position in the array by comparing it to previous elements. </p>
  	</li>
	<li><b>Bubble Sort: </b> 
  		<p>Bubble sort works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order. It requires that the set of numbers are passed over multiple times to ensure that it is sorted. </p>
  	</li>
  
</ul>
